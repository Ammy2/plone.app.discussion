Captcha Plugin Architecture
===========================

This document contains design notes for the plone.app.discussion Captcha plugin
architecture. It also explains how to write your own Captcha plugin (???).

Currently there are two plugins that work with plone.app.discussion:

    1) plone.formwidget.captcha
    2) plone.formwidget.recaptcha

1) Captcha plugin must provide the feature "plone.app.discussion-captcha":

Add this to your configure.zcml::

    <configure ...
        xmlns:meta="http://namespaces.zope.org/meta">
        <!-- Declare that plone.formwidget.captcha provides a Captcha field that 
             can be used by plone.app.discussion to add a Captcha field to comment 
             forms. -->
        <meta:provides feature="plone.app.discussion-captcha" />
    
        ...
    </configure>
    
For examples have a look at plone.formwidget.captcha
